# Introduction to High-performance computing in Python for scientists!

**Course Description**

As scientists, we need tools to transform, process, and analyse our data to understand our world. However, the complexity and amount of data is increasing rapidly. Python offers easy ways to code routines for scientific pipelines. Additionally, high-performance computing (HPC) provides new ways to calculate complex routines to reduce computational costs.

**Learning Objectives**

At the end of this course, you will:

1. Learn about traditional scientific programming pipelines to transform and visualize data.
2. Use main widely-used Python packages for scientific computing (Numpy + Matplotlib + Scipy).
3. Be able to design scripts in Python that deals with complex computations.
4. Understand main challenges and technical aspects about serial vs parallel computing.
5. Code high-performance functions written directly in Python via using Numba compiler (CPU and GPU).

**Who should attend**

This course is aimed at master students, PhD candidates, or postdocs interested in learning about Python language and introductory concepts and their applications of HPC to help them in their projects.
Prerequisites

It requires a basic understanding or experience in programming languages (e.g., Matlab, R). An introduction to Python will be provided to study before the seminar starts.
