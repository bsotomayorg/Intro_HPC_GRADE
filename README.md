# Introduction to High-Performance Computing in Python for Scientists!


**Course description**

To understand the world, we are constantly transforming, processing, and analyzing acquired data. However, the complexity and amount of data are increasing rapidly, making some calculations intractable. Python offers practical and efficient ways to code routines for scientific pipelines. Additionally, as the computational costs increase with the complexity of routines, HPC plays an important role to facilitate the calculations.

**Learning Objectives**

At the end of this course, you will learn about the followings:

+ Designing scripts in Python for data analysis.
+ Traditional scientific programming pipelines to transform and visualize data.
+ Widely-used Python packages for scientific computing.
+ Main challenges and technical aspects about sequential vs parallel computing.
+ Coding high-performance functions written directly in Python using Numba compiler (CPU and GPU).

**Who should attend**

This course is aimed at graduate students and postdocs interested in Python programming language, introductory concepts, and their applications of HPC. It requires a basic understanding of programming (e.g., data structures, control statements) or experience in other programming languages (e.g., Matlab, R).

**Prerequisites**

It requires a basic understanding or experience in programming languages (e.g., Matlab, R). An introduction to Python will be provided to study before the seminar starts.
